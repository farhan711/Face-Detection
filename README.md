# Face-Detection
Face Detection Algorithm Optimized using Python and OpenCV

## Overview
1. Creating datasets (face_datasets.py)
2. Train the model (training.py)
3. Face Recognition (face_recognition.py)

## Instructions
0. Make sure have executable permission. (chmod 777 .)
1. Please make sure that you have folders called 'datasets' and 'trainer' in the same directory. (Optional, I have put the code so it will create if it does not exist.)
2. Run in the command line the face_datasets.py for taking your face image as datasets. Don't forget to set each person's face to the unique ID (You need to edit the code every time, or maybe just change the id variable to raw_input[OPTIONAL])
3. If you have more face to be included, change the ID and run the program again
4. Train your datasets by running training.py
5. Lastly, run face_recognition.py
